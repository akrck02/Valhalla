## First of all

Hi there! Thanks for checking out this project, let's talk about **contributing to Valhalla**.
> Valhalla is open source so anyone can help to create and improve the code to make this aplication better,
> but, we need some rules in order to mantain the direction, so let's start reviewing them.

## How can I contribute?
There are several ways to change things inside Valhalla. 

- **Fix typos or syntax errors** inside the code or documentation.
- Improve **UI views or components**
- **Refactor** existing code to improve readability
- **Optimice existing** code to improve performance
- ...

## I have the ideas to help, but I'm afraid of coding...
Don't worry, open an [issue](https://github.com/akrck02/Valhalla/issues/new) telling us your idea, improvement or bug and someone will code it for you ;)

## How can I make those changes?
First of all you must clone this repository.
```git 
  git clone https://github.com/akrck02/Valhalla
```

Make the necesary changes and create a pull request pointing to the [dev branch](https://github.com/akrck02/Valhalla/tree/dev)

The reviewers will check the changes and **if they are approved, youre good to go**

## Requirements for pull requests to be approved
First of all, not every pull request will be approved if they have conflicts with the current project direction.

## Rules 
- The uploaded content cannot contain malicious software.
- The uplodaded changes cannot disrespect user privacy.
- The uploaded code must pass the security checks.

## What can I do if my changes were denied?
Don't worry, if your changes were denied, you'll be replied with feedback from the reviewers. 
If they propose you some changes, you can make them and propose your pull request again.

If your code conflicts with the project direction, remember, this is open source code so you can make changes on your own version of valhalla :)
