To report a vulnerability just [open an issue](https://github.com/akrck02/Valhalla/issues/new?assignees=&labels=security&template=Security.md&title=%5BSecurity%5D) 
and follow the steps. 

## Expected time between updates
Once an issue is opened the reviewers will work to solve the problem and 
then reply to the related issue with the updates. A security-patch will 
be released into [master branch](https://github.com/akrck02/Valhalla/tree/master)

when their lifes let them. All of them work on other companies to survive, so 
there is no estimated time for releases or patches.

have no chance to modify or patch via updates or by changing that technology,
